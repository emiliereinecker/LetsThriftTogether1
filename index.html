        <h3>How to: Find the best pieces</h3>
            <p>Thrift shopping without a clear goal is like grocery shopping on an empty stomach: It’s doable but not ideal. Make a mental list of what you’re looking for based on what you already own. This will help keep you focused and on budget. In addition, save pictures of coveted gems and fashion inspiration on your phone for quick reference. This will make it easier for store clerks to help you locate specific garments or let you know if they have something similar on the racks.</p>

        <h3>How to: Start thrifting</h3>
            <p>Depending on where you shop, some thrift stores have limited to no fitting rooms—and we don’t recommend buying something without making sure it’s a good fit, as many thrift stores don’t issue refunds or exchanges. To remedy this, wear a form-fitting tank top and biker shorts or leggings to make trying things on as easy as possible, even if it means changing in the middle of the store. For the thrift stores that do have fitting rooms, this also makes changing quick and efficient.</p>

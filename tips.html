                <h2>Tip 1: Sell before you buy</h2>
                    <p>Selling a few items that you are no longer using can help you save money for your thrifting and create storage space for your upcoming purchases. You can sell your items online or at a consignment shop before you load up on thrift store finds.</p>

                <h2>Tip 2: Find out the stores speciality beforehand</h2>
                    <p>You can make the thrift shopping experience much easier if you know what the store carries. Some thrift shops specialize in clothing or toys, while others will have a wide array of furniture or home décor. Before heading out, find out which store stocks more of the specific items you’re looking for, and search there first.</p>

                <h2>Tip 3: Give yourself a clear goal</h2>
                    <p>Thrift shopping should be about finding things you need, not meandering around looking to collect items. Take note of the things you already own, then make a mental list of the things you’re looking for. If you need to, take pictures with your smartphone to help you remember what you have and what you want.</p>

                <h2>Tip 4: Avoid impulse buys</h2>
                    <p>Thrift stores may have low prices, but it can start to add up if you buy enough items. Set a budget and leave your cards at home. Taking a cash-only approach will help you stick to your list of needs and help you avoid overspending.</p>

                <h2>Tip 5: Shop off-season</h2>
                    <p>Like with retail stores, the best time to buy seasonal clothing is when the demand is low. Shop for jackets and boots in the summer, and look for sundresses and sandals in the winter.</p>
